Files in this directory:
ModelBuild.java: This program builds the model with 70% files in each newsgroup directory
TestModel.java: This program tests the model with 30% files which were not used for training
stopWordsList.txt:	List of stopWords
model folder:   This model folder has model files which are already created after running ModelBuild.java on 70% files of each newsgroup
                If user executes ModelBuild.java, the files will be cleared off and then updated with latest values for new selection.
			
How to run the Newsgroup text Analysis:
Part-I: Run already created model on selected test files:
    1. Run TestModel.java program
	   File browser window will pop up
	2. Select newsgroup directory e.g. C:\Users\admin\Desktop\Big Data Analytics\project2\20_newsgroups\

Part-II: Build model again and then run that on selected text files
	1. Run ModelBuild.java program
	   File browser window will pop up
	2. Select newsgroup directory e.g. C:\Users\admin\Desktop\Big Data Analytics\project2\20_newsgroups\
	   (new model files will be created in model folder after 2nd step)
    3. Run TestModel.java program (Optional: Change score function - refer 174th line in TestModel.java program)
	   File browser window will pop up	
	4. Select newsgroup directory e.g. C:\Users\admin\Desktop\Big Data Analytics\project2\20_newsgroups\

Results:
	1. After running ModelBuild.java program, in model folder 20 model files are created with sorted word mapping with their count for each newsgroup
	2. After running TestModel.java program, correctly classifed, iccorrectly instances and accuracy is printed on console.
